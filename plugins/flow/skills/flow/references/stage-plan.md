# Stage: plan

## Purpose

Produce an implementation plan for the ticket and return it as your report.
You are the `Plan` subagent for the `plan` stage of `/flow`. You read the
ticket context, design the change, and hand back a plan a human will approve
before any code is written.

You do NOT write code in this stage. You do NOT touch the working tree. Your
entire output is the plan text returned as your response.

Plan approval is a human gate in the orchestration. The do-loop captures your
returned plan and the user reviews it before the implement stage runs. You
cannot wait for or solicit that approval yourself — just return a plan good
enough to approve.

## Inputs

- `.flow/runs/<KEY>/ticket.json` — the full cached ticket payload (summary,
  description, type, comments, parent, links). This is your primary source of
  intent.
- `.flow/tickets/<KEY>.md` — ticket frontmatter (status, any `planned_files`
  the user pre-seeded, commit hints). The body below the frontmatter may carry
  human notes.
- The current repository. Read the code you intend to change so the plan
  references real files and real call sites, not guesses.

## Steps

1. Read `.flow/runs/<KEY>/ticket.json` and `.flow/tickets/<KEY>.md`. Extract
   the actual goal — what behavior must exist when this ticket is done.

2. Explore the codebase enough to ground the plan. Locate the files, modules,
   and functions the change touches. Do not skim; an approver should be able to
   trust your file list.

3. Draft the plan with these sections:
   - **Goal** — one or two sentences on what success looks like.
   - **Files to change** — explicit paths, each with a one-line note on what
     changes there. This list is load-bearing: the implement stage confines
     edits to the planned files, so be complete and precise.
   - **Approach** — the design. How the pieces fit, what existing patterns you
     reuse, any new module or interface and why.
   - **Test strategy** — what unit tests prove the change. The implement stage
     is TDD-mandatory, so name the cases the implementer should write.
   - **Risks** — what could go wrong, edge cases, migration concerns, anything
     the approver should weigh.

4. Return the plan as your response. Keep it concrete and reviewable; an
   approver reading only your output should be able to say yes or no.

## Outputs

- The plan text, returned as your stage report. The do-loop captures it to
  `<ticket-dir>/stages/plan.out`. You do not write that file yourself.

## Errors

- `ticket.json` missing or empty → you cannot plan without intent. Return a
  short report stating the ticket context is unavailable and the `ticket` stage
  must run first. Do not invent a plan from the ticket key alone.
- Ticket goal genuinely ambiguous → do not guess silently. State the
  competing interpretations in your returned plan and let the approver pick.

## Skip conditions

- Skipped entirely if `workspace.toml [pipeline.handlers] plan = "none"`. In
  that case the do-loop short-circuits and this doc is never read. The
  implement stage then works from `ticket.json` + frontmatter directly.
